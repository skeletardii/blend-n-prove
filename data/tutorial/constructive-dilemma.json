  "rule_name": "Constructive Dilemma",
  "description": "Constructive Dilemma is a powerful inference rule that combines conditionals with a disjunction. If we know \"if P then Q\" AND \"if R then S\", and we also know \"P or R\" is true, then we can conclude \"Q or S\" must be true. This is a double-operation rule requiring two premises.",
