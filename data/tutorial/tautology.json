  "description": "Tautology laws deal with expressions involving TRUE. A tautology is always true regardless of other values. \"P or TRUE\" always equals TRUE (since at least TRUE is true). \"P and TRUE\" simplifies to just P (since TRUE doesn't restrict P). These laws help simplify expressions with constant truth values.",
