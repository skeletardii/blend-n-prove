  "rule_name": "Destructive Dilemma",
  "description": "Destructive Dilemma is the contrapositive form of Constructive Dilemma. If we know \"if P then Q\" AND \"if R then S\", and we also know \"not Q or not S\" is true, then we can conclude \"not P or not R\" must be true. This works by denying the consequents to deny the antecedents. This is a double-operation rule requiring two premises.",
