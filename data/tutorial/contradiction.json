  "description": "Contradiction laws deal with expressions involving FALSE. A contradiction is always false regardless of other values. \"P and FALSE\" always equals FALSE (since FALSE makes the entire conjunction false). \"P or FALSE\" simplifies to just P (since FALSE doesn't add anything). These laws help simplify expressions with constant falsehood.",
