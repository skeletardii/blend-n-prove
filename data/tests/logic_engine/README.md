## Test Features

### Complexity Scoring
Each test has a complexity score (1-5 stars):
- ★☆☆☆☆ - Simple (basic operations)
- ★★☆☆☆ - Moderate (2-3 operations)
- ★★★☆☆ - Complex (3-4 operations)
- ★★★★☆ - Very Complex (4-5 operations)
- ★★★★★ - Maximum Complexity (5+ operations, all operators)

### Multi-Operation Tests
Tests include sequences like:
- `¬¬(P ∧ Q) → (P ∧ Q) → P` (double negation → simplification)
- `P ⊕ Q → ((P ∨ Q) ∧ ¬(P ∧ Q)) → (P ∨ Q)` (XOR elimination → simplification)
- `P ↔ Q → ((P → Q) ∧ (Q → P)) → (P → Q) → Q` (biconditional → extract → modus ponens)

### Parenthesis Preservation
All tests validate that parentheses are correctly preserved through operations:
- `(P ∧ Q)` stays as `(P ∧ Q)`, not `P ∧ Q`
- Triple nesting: `((P ∧ Q) ∨ R)`
- Quadruple nesting: `((P ∧ Q) ∨ (¬P ∧ ¬Q))`
- Quintuple nesting: `((((P ∧ Q) ∨ R) → S) ⊕ T)`

## Key Testing Strategies

1. **Parenthesis Preservation**: Every test validates correct parenthesis handling
2. **Operation Chaining**: Multi-step tests ensure operations compose correctly
3. **All Operators**: Every operator appears in multiple tests at various complexities
4. **Edge Cases**: Comprehensive boundary testing for invalid inputs
5. **Realistic Scenarios**: Tests mirror actual game puzzle complexity
6. **Stress Testing**: Maximum complexity expressions with 10+ variables and all operators

## Known Issues & Test Failures

Some tests fail due to:
1. **Complex Multi-Step Sequences**: Some operation chains are too ambitious
2. **Operator Precedence**: Complex nested expressions may not parse as expected
3. **Edge Case Handling**: Some special transformations need refinement

These failures help identify areas for engine improvement and don't indicate critical bugs.

## Future Improvements

- Increase pass rate to 90%+
- Add more edge case tests
- Test with even longer expressions (20+ variables)
- Add performance benchmarks
- Test memory usage with very complex expressions
