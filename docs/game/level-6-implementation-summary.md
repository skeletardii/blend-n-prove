# Level 6 Implementation Summary

## Overview

Level 6 has been successfully implemented! This new difficulty level introduces **Natural Language to Logic Translation**, where players must interpret everyday English sentences and translate them into formal logical statements.

## Implementation Date
Completed: 2025-10-21

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Data File: `level-6.json`
**Location**: `data/classic/level-6.json`

- Created 10 carefully designed problems with increasing difficulty
- Each problem includes:
  - Natural language premises (shown to player)
  - Hidden logical premises (used for validation)
  - Natural language conclusion (shown to player)
  - Hidden logical conclusion (used for validation)
  - Interpretation hints
  - Expected operations count
  - Complete solutions

**Problem Types**:
1. Basic Modus Ponens (1 op)
2. Modus Tollens (1 op)
3. Disjunctive Syllogism (1 op)
4. Conjunction (1 op)
5. Chain of Implications (2 ops)
6. De Morgan's Law (2 ops)
7. Complex Consequent (2 ops)
8. Biconditional (2 ops)
9. Long Chain (3 ops)
10. Proof by Contradiction (5 ops)

### 2. Documentation: `level-6-design.md`
**Location**: `docs/game/level-6-design.md`

Comprehensive 300+ line documentation including:
- Educational objectives and philosophy
- Data structure specifications
- Natural language translation patterns
- Problem design guidelines
- Implementation details
- Testing recommendations
- Sample gameplay flows
- Translation reference card

### 3. GameManager Modifications
**File**: `src/game/autoloads/GameManager.gd`

**Changes**:
- Extended `OrderTemplate` class with natural language fields:
  - `is_natural_language: bool`
  - `natural_language_premises: Array[String]`
  - `natural_language_conclusion: String`
  - `interpretation_hints: Array[String]`
- Added static method `create_natural_language()` for Level 6 problems
- Extended `CustomerData` class with:
  - `is_natural_language: bool`
  - `natural_language_premises: Array[String]`
  - `natural_language_conclusion: String`
  - `set_natural_language_data()` method
- Updated `load_classic_problems()`:
  - Changed range from `(1, 6)` to `(1, 7)` to include Level 6
  - Added logic to detect and parse natural language problems
  - Loads both symbolic and natural language formats

### 4. GameplayScene Modifications
**File**: `src/ui/GameplayScene.gd`

**Changes**:
- Updated `generate_new_customer()`:
  - Changed level cap from 5 to 6
  - Added natural language data assignment for Level 6 problems
- Updated `update_customer_display()`:
  - Detects Level 6 problems via `is_natural_language` flag
  - Displays natural language sentences instead of logical symbols
  - Shows "Level 6 - Translation Challenge" header
  - Adds instruction text: "(Translate sentences to logical form)"
- Updated `complete_order_successfully()`:
  - Changed difficulty progression to allow reaching Level 6
  - Special message: "Level 6 Unlocked! Translation Challenge Begins!"
  - Ultimate completion message: "Ultimate Master Level - Incredible!"
- Updated `switch_to_phase2()`:
  - Calls different method for Level 6: `set_premises_and_target_with_display()`
  - Passes both logical target (for validation) and natural language (for display)

### 5. Phase1UI Modifications
**File**: `src/ui/Phase1UI.gd`

**Changes**:
- Updated `set_customer_data()`:
  - Shows natural language conclusion for Level 6
  - Shows logical conclusion for Levels 1-5
- Updated `update_premise_checklist()`:
  - Displays natural language sentences for Level 6
  - Displays logical symbols for Levels 1-5
  - Uses index-based completion checking
- Added `is_premise_completed_by_index()`:
  - Validates against hidden logical premises by index
  - Supports Level 6's dual representation (display vs validation)
- Updated `validate_current_input()`:
  - Different success message for Level 6: "✓ Correct translation!"
  - Different error message for Level 6: "✗ That doesn't match the sentence meaning. Try again!"
  - Standard messages for Levels 1-5

### 6. Phase2UI Modifications
**File**: `src/ui/Phase2UI.gd`

**Changes**:
- Added new method `set_premises_and_target_with_display()`:
  - Accepts logical target for validation
  - Accepts display target for player visibility
  - Validates against hidden logical conclusion
  - Displays natural language conclusion to player
- Maintains backward compatibility with original `set_premises_and_target()` for Levels 1-5

## How It Works

### Phase 1: Translation
1. Player sees natural language sentences (e.g., "If it rains, then the ground is wet.")
2. Player uses virtual keyboard to input logical translation (e.g., "P → Q")
3. System validates against HIDDEN logical premises
4. Feedback:
   - ✓ "Correct translation!" if matches
   - ✗ "That doesn't match the sentence meaning" if incorrect

### Phase 2: Logical Proof
1. Player sees natural language goal (e.g., "The ground is wet.")
2. Available premises show player's logical translations from Phase 1
3. Player applies logical operations as in other levels
4. Target validated against hidden logical conclusion
5. Standard Phase 2 workflow continues

## Key Design Decisions

### Dual Representation
- **Display Layer**: Natural language (shown to player)
- **Validation Layer**: Logical symbols (hidden, used for checking)
- This allows players to work with language while system validates logic

### Progressive Difficulty
- Level 6 problems require 5+ operations (most complex)
- Builds on all skills from Levels 1-5
- Adds translation challenge on top of proof complexity

### Educational Value
Players develop:
- Critical reading skills
- Pattern recognition in natural language
- Formal logic translation ability
- Understanding of logical structure in everyday communication

## Testing Checklist

Before release, verify:

- [ ] Level 6 loads correctly from JSON
- [ ] Natural language sentences display properly in Phase 1
- [ ] Logical symbol input still works with virtual keyboard
- [ ] Validation works against hidden premises
- [ ] Correct translation feedback appears
- [ ] Phase 2 receives translated premises
- [ ] Natural language goal displays in Phase 2
- [ ] Target validation works against hidden conclusion
- [ ] Level progression from 5 to 6 works
- [ ] All 10 problems are solvable
- [ ] Messages are appropriate and helpful
- [ ] Performance is acceptable

## Example Problem Flow

**Problem**: "If it rains, then the ground is wet. It is raining. Prove: The ground is wet."

### Phase 1:
```
Display: "If it rains, then the ground is wet."
Player Input: P → Q
Validation: Checks against hidden "P → Q" ✓

Display: "It is raining."
Player Input: P
Validation: Checks against hidden "P" ✓

→ Advance to Phase 2
```

### Phase 2:
```
Available: P → Q, P
Goal Display: "The ground is wet."
Goal Validation: Q (hidden)

Player: Select Modus Ponens on (P → Q, P)
Result: Q ✓ Target reached!
```

## Future Enhancements

Potential additions for future versions:

1. **Variable Naming**: Let players assign their own variable names
2. **Multiple Translations**: Accept logically equivalent forms
3. **Translation Tutorial**: Dedicated mode teaching patterns
4. **Hint System**: Progressive hints for translation
5. **Custom Problems**: Player-created natural language puzzles
6. **Difficulty Variants**: Easy/Medium/Hard within Level 6
7. **Achievement System**: Track translation accuracy
8. **Analytics**: Identify which patterns players struggle with

## Known Limitations

- Only one correct translation accepted (no logical equivalents)
- Variable names are predetermined (P, Q, R, S, T)
- No intermediate hints during translation
- Limited to 10 predefined problems

## Conclusion

Level 6 successfully bridges the gap between formal logic and natural language reasoning. Players who master this level demonstrate:
- Complete understanding of boolean logic operations
- Ability to recognize logical patterns in natural language
- Skills in formal logic translation
- Mastery of complex multi-step proofs

This implementation represents the culmination of the Boolean Logic Bartender's educational journey, transforming players from logic learners into logic translators capable of applying formal reasoning to everyday communication.
