# Disjunctive Syllogism

## Description
Disjunctive Syllogism states that if we have "P or Q" and we know "not P", then Q must be true. It's the process of elimination in logic.

## Rule Pattern
P ∨ Q, ¬P ⊢ Q

## Problems

### Problem 1 (Difficulty: Easy)
**Premises:**
- P ∨ Q
- ¬P

**Conclusion:** Q

**Brief Solution:** Apply Disjunctive Syllogism: eliminate P, leaving Q.

---

### Problem 2 (Difficulty: Easy)
**Premises:**
- R ∨ S
- ¬R

**Conclusion:** S

**Brief Solution:** Eliminate R from the disjunction, concluding S.

---

### Problem 3 (Difficulty: Easy)
**Premises:**
- A ∨ B
- ¬B

**Conclusion:** A

**Brief Solution:** Eliminate B from the disjunction, concluding A.

---

### Problem 4 (Difficulty: Medium)
**Premises:**
- (P ∧ Q) ∨ R
- ¬(P ∧ Q)

**Conclusion:** R

**Brief Solution:** Apply Disjunctive Syllogism where one disjunct is a conjunction.

---

### Problem 5 (Difficulty: Medium)
**Premises:**
- P ∨ (Q ∧ R)
- ¬P

**Conclusion:** Q ∧ R

**Brief Solution:** Eliminate P, leaving the conjunction "Q ∧ R".

---

### Problem 6 (Difficulty: Medium)
**Premises:**
- (P → Q) ∨ R
- ¬(P → Q)

**Conclusion:** R

**Brief Solution:** Apply Disjunctive Syllogism where one disjunct is an implication.

---

### Problem 7 (Difficulty: Hard)
**Premises:**
- P ∨ Q
- ¬P
- Q → R

**Conclusion:** R

**Brief Solution:** Apply Disjunctive Syllogism to get Q, then Modus Ponens to get R.

---

### Problem 8 (Difficulty: Hard)
**Premises:**
- (P ∧ Q) ∨ (R ∧ S)
- ¬(P ∧ Q)

**Conclusion:** R ∧ S

**Brief Solution:** Eliminate the first conjunction, leaving the second.

---

### Problem 9 (Difficulty: Hard)
**Premises:**
- P ∨ Q
- P → R
- ¬P

**Conclusion:** Q

**Brief Solution:** Apply Disjunctive Syllogism to eliminate P and conclude Q.

---

### Problem 10 (Difficulty: Very Hard)
**Premises:**
- (P → Q) ∨ (R → S)
- ¬(P → Q)
- R

**Conclusion:** S

**Brief Solution:** Apply Disjunctive Syllogism to get "R → S", then Modus Ponens with R to get S.
