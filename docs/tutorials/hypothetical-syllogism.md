# Hypothetical Syllogism

## Description
Hypothetical Syllogism allows us to chain implications together. If P implies Q and Q implies R, then P implies R.

## Rule Pattern
P → Q, Q → R ⊢ P → R

## Problems

### Problem 1 (Difficulty: Easy)
**Premises:**
- P → Q
- Q → R

**Conclusion:** P → R

**Brief Solution:** Apply Hypothetical Syllogism directly to chain the implications.

---

### Problem 2 (Difficulty: Easy)
**Premises:**
- A → B
- B → C

**Conclusion:** A → C

**Brief Solution:** Chain the implications using Hypothetical Syllogism.

---

### Problem 3 (Difficulty: Easy)
**Premises:**
- R → S
- S → T

**Conclusion:** R → T

**Brief Solution:** Direct application of Hypothetical Syllogism.

---

### Problem 4 (Difficulty: Medium)
**Premises:**
- P → Q
- Q → R
- R → S

**Conclusion:** P → S

**Brief Solution:** Apply Hypothetical Syllogism twice: first to get "P → R", then again to get "P → S".

---

### Problem 5 (Difficulty: Medium)
**Premises:**
- (P ∧ Q) → R
- R → S

**Conclusion:** (P ∧ Q) → S

**Brief Solution:** Apply Hypothetical Syllogism where the antecedent is a conjunction.

---

### Problem 6 (Difficulty: Medium)
**Premises:**
- P → (Q ∨ R)
- (Q ∨ R) → S

**Conclusion:** P → S

**Brief Solution:** Apply Hypothetical Syllogism where the middle term is a disjunction.

---

### Problem 7 (Difficulty: Hard)
**Premises:**
- P → Q
- Q → R
- R → S
- S → T

**Conclusion:** P → T

**Brief Solution:** Apply Hypothetical Syllogism three times to chain all implications.

---

### Problem 8 (Difficulty: Hard)
**Premises:**
- P → Q
- Q → (R ∧ S)
- (R ∧ S) → T

**Conclusion:** P → T

**Brief Solution:** Apply Hypothetical Syllogism twice, treating "R ∧ S" as a single unit.

---

### Problem 9 (Difficulty: Hard)
**Premises:**
- (P ∨ Q) → R
- R → (S ∧ T)

**Conclusion:** (P ∨ Q) → (S ∧ T)

**Brief Solution:** Apply Hypothetical Syllogism with complex antecedent and consequent.

---

### Problem 10 (Difficulty: Very Hard)
**Premises:**
- P → (Q → R)
- (Q → R) → S
- S → T

**Conclusion:** P → T

**Brief Solution:** Apply Hypothetical Syllogism twice to chain the nested implications.
