# Tutorial Status Assessment

## Overall Status: ⚠️ PARTIAL IMPLEMENTATION

The tutorial system has **basic functionality** but requires significant enhancement to fully meet requirements. While a foundation exists, the system needs expansion for interactive demonstrations and experimental features.

## Implementation Analysis

### 1. Rule Demos ⚠️ BASIC IMPLEMENTATION
**Location**: `scripts/autoloads/TutorialManager.gd:1-100`

**Current Implementation**:
- **Text-Based Tutorial Steps**: Static tutorial messages with step progression
- **Basic Overlay System**: Simple UI overlay for tutorial display
- **Linear Progression**: Sequential step-by-step tutorial flow
- **Basic Integration**: Tutorial system integrated with main game flow

**Current Tutorial Content**:
```gdscript
var tutorial_steps: Array[String] = [
    "Welcome to Boolean Logic Bartender! You'll learn formal logic by serving customers.",
    "Phase 1: Look at the customer's order. You need to recreate their premises using ingredients.",
    "Click the ingredient buttons (P, Q, operators) to build logical expressions.",
    "Press 'Validate' when you've built a premise. It will be added to your tray.",
    "Phase 2: Use inference rules to transform premises and reach the conclusion.",
    "Select premises with checkboxes, then click an inference rule to apply it.",
    "Complete all tutorials by serving your first customer successfully!"
]
```

**Limitations of Current System**:
1. **Static Text Only**: No interactive demonstrations of rules
2. **No Rule-Specific Demos**: Missing individual inference rule tutorials
3. **No Visual Examples**: Lacks step-by-step visual rule applications
4. **No Practice Mode**: No isolated practice environment for specific rules
5. **Limited Feedback**: Basic next/previous navigation only

### 2. Tutorial Progress Tracking ⚠️ MINIMAL IMPLEMENTATION
**Location**: `scripts/autoloads/TutorialManager.gd:82-90`

**Current Implementation**:
- **Step Completion Signals**: Basic signal emission on step completion
- **Current Step Tracking**: Simple integer-based progress tracking
- **Tutorial Mode Flag**: Boolean flag for tutorial state management

**Current Progress Features**:
```gdscript
signal tutorial_step_completed(step_index: int)
var current_step: int = 0
var is_tutorial_mode: bool = false
```

**Missing Progress Features**:
1. **Individual Rule Mastery**: No tracking of specific rule comprehension
2. **Performance Metrics**: No tutorial completion times or error tracking
3. **Adaptive Tutorials**: No difficulty adjustment based on user performance
4. **Skill Assessment**: No evaluation of tutorial effectiveness
5. **Persistence**: Tutorial progress not saved between sessions

### 3. Experimental Mode ❌ NOT IMPLEMENTED

**Current Status**: No experimental mode implementation found

**Missing Features**:
1. **Sandbox Environment**: Free-play mode for experimentation
2. **Custom Expression Testing**: Ability to test arbitrary logical expressions
3. **Rule Playground**: Interactive environment for trying inference rules
4. **What-If Scenarios**: Exploration of different logical approaches
5. **Guided Exploration**: Structured experimentation with hints

## Current Tutorial System Architecture

### TutorialManager Class Analysis ⚠️ BASIC
**Location**: `scripts/autoloads/TutorialManager.gd:1-100`

**Existing Features**:

- **Static Content**: Fixed text-based explanations only
- **No Validation**: No checking of user understanding
- **Poor Accessibility**: No options for different learning styles

## Analysis of Game Engine Integration

### Available Teaching Infrastructure ✅ EXCELLENT
**Location**: `scripts/autoloads/BooleanLogicEngine.gd`

**Tutorial-Ready Features**:
- **Comprehensive Rule Set**: 33+ logical operations available for teaching
